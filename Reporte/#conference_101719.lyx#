\begin_layout Abstract
All vehicule drivers have some implicit profile that help us to recognize
 them.
 The target is to show an alert when a suspicus driving behaviour is detected.
 The main idea is to prevent car theft or a rude behavior of drivers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The training data of the project is got from the city of cinnacity which
 give free sources of GPS data and some other variants for public driving
 services.
 This includes street sweepers, trash packers, and snow plows.
 Vehicles are identified by location and asset number.
 The main idea is to use this variables for use machine learning techniques
 for filter , preprocess data and then use random forest to predict the
 behaviour of the the driver.
 Note that for each asset number we assume a diferent driver.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once downloading the data set of the project, it could be seen that the
 .csv file was completely unsorted , so first of all it was needed to arrange
 them by vehicule ID, and then sort them by time, to do this task it was
 used pandas framework in python3.6

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 After look some maps plots, there has been some GPS outlier data because
 sensor sometimes has huge errors.
 To solve this problem the main idea was to generate a feature that track
 euclidian distance between points, and remove certain points that overstepped
 the bounds of a threshold.

\begin_layout Standard
To set up the threshold it was set a filter which take batches of 100 samples
 to generate a normal distribution, then it move the maximum likelihood
 to the max value of the batch, and set a threshold of 95% of acceptance.
 So any value that is bigger than 95% likelihood it will be discarded and
 checked as an outlier.
 First this proces generate a gaussian curve in sample N and then we use
 the gaussian filter in N+1.
 So if the upcoming data has not likely data the set split into a new set,
 and the noisy point is removed.
 Then this was made so on with the next batches of 100 samples.
 This help to work with individual files that are shorter and has more likely
 data, and on the other hand, we could used them as training and testing
 data because they belong to the same driver, however the GPS fails.

Features Generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the given data has this default features: LATITUDE,LONGITUDE,REASONS,SPEED,
 HEADING,TIME.
 On the other hand this features were not good enought.
 This drives to generate other features that supplement the information,
 some of this generated features are: Distance between points, X_POLAR ,Y_POLAR,
 and Weighted Frequency Domain.
 The first one is the distance of the points of GPS, it is the same used
 for extract outliers.
 Morever the polar cordinates are gotten from a combination of SPEED and
 HEADING(compas split on 16 directions).

PCA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once all features are generated the PCA is used to obtain the most relevant
 features of the data.
 In the image below it could be seen that the latitude and longitude variables
 depend on each other so they are highly correlated, which it must be discarded
 because they are not orthogonal and the only thing they do is to give unnecessa
ry information.
 Intead we vould observed that WFD and polar cordenates has lower covariance
 with other varables and between each other.

\noindent
When the correlation matrix is centerd and the eigenvalues and eingvectors
 are arranged, we could visualize the relevance for each feature.
 This provide a more clear overview of which features should be selected
 and discarded in relation with others ones that may not contribute to much.
 As it was said before the most ortogonals variables was the wfd, and polar
 cordenates, so it be very possible that they are the winners of the PCA.

 Rember that these polar represenation is composed by the radius as the
 vehicule speed and the turn angle as a compas direction, for instance it
 is not being used the Lat and Lon data, but we may use other strategies
 in the future to make them more useful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally we could test the PCA clasification between two random drivers,
 that has different behavior and routes of driving, we only take the two
 most relevant features that are the polar cordantes.
 As a result it is wanted to see two different clusters well separeted and
 clasified.

The DBSCAN algorithm will help to determine if two cluster from the PCA
 output are seperable.
 Thhe advantage of this one between K-means is that doesn't be determined
 the number of cluster a priori, also there are not round shaped, and has
 notion of noise.

On the other hand it has two hyperparamters for good and not supervised
 clasification.
 Epislon and min num of cluster, which they are looked by bruteforce searching,
 the main idea is to compare one by one driver with a target driver, so
 there are certain hyperparameters wich give higher number of clusters,
 but the may be produce noise them toghter, so we will look for a medium
 solution, and we may need to score this clasification in other way, and
 there is where random forest is used.

\begin_layout Subsection
Random Forest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Random Forest is selected as averaging 15 trees, this was totaly experimental.
 As more trees are added there is not visual difference.
 To find the best split a single tree there was ran multiple times different
 posibilities, and the calculate its variance.
 The one with less variance will be the best fit.
 So this mean de desicion will be the better.

Spliting the target driver in training data and testing data, we have a
 good training over the time with random Forest.
 The main idea is to test in average result of N samples, and append more
 samples over the time.
 At first instance the model is confused to recognized if the driver is
 indeed himself, then as time passes it does better.

\begin_layout Standard
Finally it was decided to merge all strategies developed in order to found
 a better perfomance over time.
 So first at all we look to fit better the hypermeters for DBscan clustering.
 To do this we compare our target driver with other drivers, this is done
 passing throught a PCA compression and then running a DBSCAN algorithm
 to look if 2 clusters are distinguishible between them.

The procedure continue until go over all drivers.
 The result of good clusters are saved in a set, and then this one is loaded
 into a Random Forest training.
 For this test we get a score and we follow a semi supervised leraning.
 This procedure is executed over 10,000 with different hypermater trials
 and it was look to find the best match with the best score.

In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation
 marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or
 name is cited, such as a title or full quotation.
 When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to
 highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation
 marks.
 A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated
 outside of the closing parenthesis (like this).
 (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)

Authors and Affiliations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.

\series default
 A minimum of one author is required for all conference articles.
 Author names should be listed starting from left to right and then moving
 down to the next line.
 This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations and by
 indexing services.
 Names should not be listed in columns nor group by affiliation.
 Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for example, do
 not differentiate among departments of the same organization).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Identify the Headings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through
 your paper.
 There are two types: component heads and text heads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are
 not topically subordinate to each other.
 Examples include Acknowledgments and References and, for these, the correct
 style to use is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Heading 5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

figure caption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for your Figure captions, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

table head
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for your table title.
 Run-in heads, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Abstract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, will require you to apply a style (in this case, italic) in addition to
 the style provided by the drop down menu to differentiate the head from
 the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis.
 For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent
 material relates and elaborates on this one topic.
 If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman
 numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two
 sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced.

Positioning Figures and Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns.
 Avoid placing them in the middle of columns.
 Large figures and tables may span across both columns.
 Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear
 above the tables.
 Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text.
 Use the abbreviation 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels.
 Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis
 labels to avoid confusing the reader.
 As an example, write the quantity 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Magnetization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Magnetization, M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If including units in the label, present them within parentheses.
 Do not label axes only with units.
 In the example, write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Magnetization (A/m)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Magnetization {A[m(1)]}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A/m
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units.
 For example, write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Temperature (K)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
